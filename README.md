# Reinforcement Learning Handin
Code for the project in reinforcement learning written by Marc Jensen.
The code in this repo has taken inspiration from the book by Lapan, Maxim: 

Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On - Second Edition. Packt Publishing, 2020.

Note that python/package dependencies can be found in the environment.yml file.

I have implemented some different functionalities in the package: [rele_pack](rele_pack). Here is the environment code
written.

The other subdirectories contain:

- [Deep_Q-learning](Deep_Q-learning): Implementation and hyperparameter tuning files for the deep Q-learning algorithm.
- [DQFD](DQFD): Implementation and hyperparameter tuning files for the Deep Q learning From Demonstrations setup.
- [Q-learning](Q-learning): Implementation and hyperparameter tuning files for the Q-learning algorithms.
- [Value-iteration](Value-iteration): Implementation of the value iteration method.
- [expert_policy](expert_policy): Implementation of the expert policy.
